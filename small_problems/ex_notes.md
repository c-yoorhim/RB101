## Exercise Tips

*General*
- Code with intent; don't method hunt
- Simplify AFTER you have code that works
- Write code that is clear to me

*When You're Struggling*
- Think about why it's not working
- Study the error messages
- Use irb/pry to explore
- Instead of rerouting: what needs to change to get it to work? Change it.
- If you can't get it, take a break and come back to it
  - If you still can't get it: peek at the solution's approach/algorithm section
  - Study the solution then go back and try agiain without looking

*When It Works*
- Compare to solution and discussion
- If it looks different, ask:
  - What does the solution do differently?
  - Why did they do it differently?
  - Does my program miss any "edge cases"? 
- Compare your solution to other students'
- What can you do to make your code easier to understand?
- Explore anything interesting in the Ruby Docs

*When You Think You Did 'Em All*
- Go back to those that gave you difficulty
- Try the 'Further Exploration' sections once you fully understand the original problem
